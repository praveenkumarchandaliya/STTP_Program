# GAN Network and Variants Implementation using PyTorch
Overview
This repository contains implementations of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and their popular variants using PyTorch. GANs are a class of machine learning frameworks where two neural networks contest with each other in a game, leading to the generation of high-quality synthetic data.
# Implementations Included
- Basic GAN Vanilla GAN implementation with generator and discriminator networks
- Training on MNIST/FashionMNIST/CIFAR-10 datasets

# Popular GAN Variants
- DCGAN (Deep Convolutional GAN): Uses convolutional and convolutional-transpose layers
- Improved architecture for image generation LSGAN
- CGAN (Conditional GAN)
- Extension of GAN that uses additional label information
- Enables controlled generation based on class labels

# Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch 1.8+
- torchvision
- numpy
- matplotlib
- tqdm (for progress bars)
-(Optional) TensorBoard for visualization
